    "# Getting elemental maps from EELS data using eXSpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, elemental maps of copper and zinc will be created from electron energy loss spectra (EELS). The data is recorded using a sample of copper and zinc oxide deposited on carbon nanotubes. The particles are likely to be very small, and the carbon is not completely covered. In this sample, the ratio of Zn and Cu is 3:1, and approximately 80 wt% of the sample is carbon. Due to the small amount of copper and zinc, the signal strength is low. To improve the signal strength without lowering the spatial resolution, the spectra were recorded with a high energy dispersion, resulting in low energy resolution. This means that any fine structure is not visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the material system and how the results of this processing can be used, see the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2019.02.045\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires `HyperSpy` 2.0 or higher. It also requires `eXSpy` which is a library which contains all of HyperSpy's EELS and EDX functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective is to show how the functionalities of `HyperSpy` and `eXSpy` can be used to create relative elemental maps from EEL spectra."

    "In core loss EELS data such as this, we typically have two major types of features: the plasmon background and the core loss edges. The core loss edges originates from specific elements, and can be used to estimate the amount of that element. The plasmon background originates from collective electron motions in the material, and needs to be removed before the element amount can be estimated. This background removal is typically done by fitting a power law to the region before the core loss edge.\n",

    "However, if an EEL spectrum has two or more core loss edges, the intensity from the core loss edge situated at a lower energy must be accounted for somehow if we want to get the intensity from the edge at higher energy.\n",
